DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
🔍 What it is:

Finds clusters based on density (many nearby points).
Labels low-density points as noise/outliers.
No need to predefine number of clusters.
📈 Diagram:

    Cluster 1     Noise    Cluster 2
    ● ● ● ●        x       ◯ ◯ ◯ ◯
🌍 Real-life Example:

Detecting anomalies in network traffic.
Identifying groups of friends at school; "loners" are outliers.
👨‍💻 Code:

from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

X = [[1], [2], [3], [10], [11], [12], [100]]  # 100 is an outlier
model = DBSCAN(eps=2)
model.fit(X)

print("Labels:", model.labels_)  # [-1 means outlier]
