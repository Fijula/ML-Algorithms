Linear Regression
What it is: 
Predicts a number (output) based on input values. Imagine drawing the best straight line through data points.
A supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks.
It predicts a continuous numerical value based on one or more input variables.
The goal is to fit the best straight line (called a regression line) through the data points that minimizes the prediction error.
Real-life Example: Predicting your score based on hours you study.

Code Example:
python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
X = [[2], [4], [6], [8]]  # study hours
y = [60, 70, 80, 90]      # scores
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
print(model.predict([[5]]))  # Predict score for 5 hours

  |               *
  |          * (6, 80)

Use it when:

You want to predict a numeric value
Thereâ€™s a linear relationship between input and output
Examples:
Predict house prices from area
Predict salary from years of experience
Predict weight from height
