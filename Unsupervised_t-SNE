t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
🔍 What it is:

Reduces complexity of high-dimensional data for visualization, preserving local relationships.
Better than PCA for visualizing clusters.
📈 Diagram:

From a mess:

●●●●●●◯◯◯◯◯◯
To a meaningful 2D map:

Cluster A     Cluster B
●●●●●         ◯◯◯◯◯
🌍 Real-life Example:

Visualizing handwritten digits, grouping similar ones together.
Mapping genomic data into patterns.
👨‍💻 Code:

from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import numpy as np

X = np.random.rand(10, 5)
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2)
print("2D Representation:", tsne.fit_transform(X))
