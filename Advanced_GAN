GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)

🔍 What it is:
A creative AI setup made of two neural networks:

Generator: tries to create fake data that looks real.
Discriminator: tries to tell if data is real or fake.
They compete: generator gets better at faking, discriminator gets better at detecting.

🔁 Diagram:
Noise → [Generator] → Fake Data → [Discriminator] ← Real Data

🌍 Real-life Examples:
Deepfakes
AI art generators
Creating realistic faces of fake people
Enhancing blurry images
👨‍💻 Code (Simple GAN Setup):
# Pseudocode using TensorFlow
generator = build_generator()
discriminator = build_discriminator()

for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Train Discriminator
    real = get_real_samples()
    fake = generator.predict(noise)
    train_discriminator(real, fake)

    # Train Generator
    noise = generate_noise()
    train_generator_via_discriminator(noise)
🧠 Full implementations use TensorFlow or PyTorch, typically requiring GPUs for training.

✅ When to Use:
Generative tasks (images, audio, data)
You need realistic outputs from random noise
For simulations and content generation
