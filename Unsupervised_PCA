PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
🔍 What it is:

Reduces dimensions by projecting data onto fewer axes that capture the most variance.
Great for visualizing high-dimensional data.
📈 Diagram:

High-D (3D) → Lower-D (2D)
[●●●→]  =>  [●●●→]
🌍 Real-life Example:

Summarizing a 1000-feature document into just 2 or 3 important topics.
Compressing images.
👨‍💻 Code:

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
pca = PCA(n_components=1)
print("Reduced Data:", pca.fit_transform(X))
